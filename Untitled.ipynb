    "## Camera Calibration\n",
    "In the camera Calibration Step we would have some test images in test folder (chessboard image) through which we have calibrate camera image or removing destortion. in this section we will find the cameraMetrix and distortionMetrix through which we can undestorted another images.\n",

    "### Normal Line Search (line search around past lines)\n",
    "The Window search only apply when pipeline will not find the line or any bad frame. In this Code section we made 50 px boundary around the previous line, For next frames we will search line within this boundary untill bad frame comes\n",

    "Finally we get the predicted lines now we will draw a polynomial with the help of predicted lines cordinates.\n",

    "### Issuse\n",
    "1. to get the best result of thresholding I had tune several time the threshold points and i had tried varoius combination of thresholding to get yellow and white lines\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In some Bad Frame or low light are or darker frame this code get confused and not work well\n",
    "\n",
    "### Improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "1. This code is working fine but in some case when bad frame comes in that condition we will check the we getting line or not if we not get any line the we will take help from previours detected line and will draw an avarage line \n"
